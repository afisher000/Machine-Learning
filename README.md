# Machine Learning Repository
I created this repository to clean/organized my old machine learning projects so the useful code scripts and easy to find.

The MNIST dataset is a classical starting project for those learning about machine learning. I added my own twist by creating a dataset by hand, using the OpenCV library to parse images of handwritten digits and automatically apply labeling.
